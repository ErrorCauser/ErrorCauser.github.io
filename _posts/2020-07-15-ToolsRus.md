Hello Guys!

In this Post I am going to share my ToolsRus CTF experience with you.
Your challenge is to use the tools listed below to enumerate a server, gathering information along 
the way that will eventually lead to you taking over the machine.
This CTF Requires the following Tools:
    
- Dirbuster
- Hydra
- Nmap
- Nikto
- Metasploit

First of all we will Enumerate the Machine. 

I started with a Nmap Scan followed by a Gobuster Scan on Port 80 with the famous common.txt Wordlits.

Once I navigated into the **/guidelines** Directory, I found a potential Username **Bob**.

The Port 1234 is open. It is running Apache Tomcat/7.0.88.

Here are the Results of Gobsuter on Port 1234:

Next thing I did was a Bruteforce attack with rockyou on the **/protected** Direction, since it requires a Password.

In order to crack the Passoword I used Hydra with the following Command:

```$ hydra -l bob -P {YOUR WORDLIST} -f {MACHINE_IP} http-get /protected/```

As we got into the Site, we got a Picture saying "This Protected Page has now moved to a different Port".

I ran Nikto against Port **1234** afterwards to find our new loginpage.

I tried to login to the **Tomcat Manager** on Port 1234 with the same Credentials. It worked.

![tomcatmanager](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/723180241140318278/733060078973878302/unknown.png)

As a Manager we have the ability to Upload a **WAR** File. You could created a WAR File with a Linux Payload and upload it.

![upload-tomcat](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/723180241140318278/733062009540706444/unknown.png)

As it turns out, this Tomcat Server is very outdated and vulnerable. I found a Metasploit Module to ecploit the Manager on Port 1234.
The Module is called **exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload**. It spwans a Meterpreter Session.

We get the Shell as the Root User. The next thing I did was getting the Root Flag, which is stored in **/root/flag.txt**.
