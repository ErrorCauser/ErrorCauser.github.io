&lt;p&gt;Hello Guys!
Today we will discuss the Mr.Robot CTF on TryHackMe.com
The Room was Simple and Fun. It contained a Wordpress Website, the Goal was to Root the System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;URL: &lt;a href=&quot;https://tryhackme.com/room/mrrobot&quot;&gt;Mr Robot CTF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty: Easy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Author: &lt;a href=&quot;https://tryhackme.com/p/ben&quot;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Step is to Enumerate the System. Below we see the Nmap Scan Results.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/723180241140318278/732637299380322304/unknown.png&quot; alt=&quot;nmap-scan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the Port 80 is open and assigned to a Web-Server. As we check out the Website,
we get a Mr.Robot themed Terminal, it appears to be a rabbit Hole.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/723180241140318278/732638395393900554/unknown.png&quot; alt=&quot;mrorobotsite&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we got a Website, I ran Gobuster with the “/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt” wordlist against the
Site. Here were all the Results I got:
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/723180241140318278/732642289565958225/unknown.png&quot; alt=&quot;gobuster&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got robots.txt as a Hit. The robots.txt, also known as the Robots Exlucion Standart Protocoll, is a Text-File which specify, which 
Directories can be readed and which not. The so called “Crawlers” from Web Browsers, always search for the 
robots.txt File when calling a Website, that way the Browsers know which Directories they are allowed to Display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the Directory &lt;strong&gt;key-1-of-3.txt&lt;/strong&gt; in the robots.txt File. In the Directory I found my First Key.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/723180241140318278/732640712604254228/unknown.png&quot; alt=&quot;robots.txt&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/723180241140318278/732640932029136946/unknown.png&quot; alt=&quot;firstkey&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may also saw, there was a /login Directory displayed on Gobuster. As we navigate to it,
we can see, its a Wordpress Website. 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/723180241140318278/732643118310228050/unknown.png&quot; alt=&quot;wordpresslogin&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a txt File from the Room before, it contained the Password. The File had a lot of Words in seperate Lines in it. All I had to do was to
use the Command &lt;strong&gt;uniq&lt;/strong&gt; with the parameter &lt;strong&gt;-u&lt;/strong&gt; to sort out the File. I got 8 Entrys left in the Output, one of them had to be the Password. The Password was
&lt;strong&gt;ER28-0652&lt;/strong&gt;.
As we got no Username, we could either start a Dictionary Attack with common Usernames, start a Bruteforce Attack. As we know, this is a Mr. Robot based 
Room, so I tried Names from Characters. Turns out the Username was Elliot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now successfully gained access to the WordPress Panel. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/723180241140318278/732666213263474889/unknown.png&quot; alt=&quot;wordpresspanel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In there, I enumerated further for more Informations. I found another User called &lt;strong&gt;michi05654&lt;/strong&gt;. Turns out that this User (Subscriber) wasnt relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I got Access to the Plugin Manager, I simply uploaded a &lt;a href=&quot;http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell&quot;&gt;PHP Reverse Shell Script&lt;/a&gt;. 
Now there were two ways, either I uploaded a completley new Plugin or I change a existing one. I setted up a Netcat Listener on Port 4444, edited an existing Plugin and successfully
got a Reverse Shell. 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/723180241140318278/732673375519899749/unknown.png&quot; alt=&quot;netcat&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, we are a so called “Daemon”. A Daemon is  a process that runs in the background and performs a specified operation at predefined times or in response to certain events. 
I imported Python and spawned the Bash Shell with the following Command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/723180241140318278/732676093378560100/unknown.png&quot; alt=&quot;shell&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Next key was located in &lt;strong&gt;/home/robot&lt;/strong&gt;. It was a MD5 Hash, so I cracked it with Hashcat and the famous rockyou.txt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To obtain the 3rd and last Flag, I had to get Root Privilleges. I used the Command &lt;strong&gt;nmap –interactive&lt;/strong&gt; followed by &lt;strong&gt;!sh&lt;/strong&gt; to obtain a Root Shell.
I could easily navigate to /root and get the last Key.
