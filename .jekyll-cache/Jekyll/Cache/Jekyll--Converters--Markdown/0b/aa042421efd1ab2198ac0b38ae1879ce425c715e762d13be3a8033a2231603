<p>Hello Guys!
Today we will discuss the Mr.Robot CTF on TryHackMe.com
The Room was Simple and Fun. It contained a Wordpress Website, the Goal was to Root the System.</p>

<p>Difficulty: Easy</p>

<p>#Enumeration</p>

<p>The first Step is to Enumerate the System. Below we see the Nmap Scan Results.

<p>As we can see, the Port 80 is open and assigned to a Web-Server. As we check out the Website,
we get a Mr.Robot themed Terminal, it appears to be a rabbit Hole.

<p>Since we got a Website, I ran Gobuster with the ‚Äú/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt‚Äù wordlist against the
Site. Here were all the Results I got:

<p>I got robots.txt as a Hit. The robots.txt, also known as the Robots Exlucion Standart Protocoll, is a Text-File which specify, which 
Directories can be readed and which not. The so called ‚ÄúCrawlers‚Äù from Web Browsers, always search for the 
robots.txt File when calling a Website, that way the Browsers know which Directories they are allowed to Display.</p>

<p>I got the Directory <strong>key-1-of-3.txt</strong> in the robots.txt File. In the Directory I found my First Key.
